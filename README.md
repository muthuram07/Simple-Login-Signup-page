<h1>Simple Login and Signup Page</h1>
This project provides a basic web page with a Login and Signup form, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Signup page allows users to create a new account by entering their credentials, while the Login page allows registered users to authenticate using their credentials. The project includes client-side validation for the form inputs to ensure proper user data is submitted.

The application is designed to be simple and responsive, making it suitable for educational purposes and as a starting point for more advanced authentication systems.
